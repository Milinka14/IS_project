It is a Java-based audio streaming information system that allows users to upload, listen to, and rate audio recordings. The system also supports subscription-based premium packages, enabling users to access additional features based on their subscription plans.

The architecture consists of a client application, a central server, and three microservices (subsystems). The client application, implemented in Java SE, allows users to interact with the system through either a console or a GUI, sending REST API requests to the central server. The central server acts as an intermediary, processing these requests and forwarding them to the appropriate subsystems using Java Message Service (JMS). Each subsystem is responsible for different aspects of the system: user and location management (Subsystem 1), audio and category handling (Subsystem 2), and subscription, rating, and playback tracking (Subsystem 3).

Users can register with their personal details, including name, email, age, and location. They can upload audio recordings, assign them to multiple categories, and listen to recordings with playback tracking. The system also allows users to rate audio files on a scale of 1 to 5, add them to their favorites list, and manage monthly subscriptions to premium packages. Subscription management ensures that only one active subscription per user exists at a time, with automatic expiration after one month.

The project utilizes Java 8, Spring Boot for the REST API, JMS for inter-service communication, and MySQL as the database backend. UML diagrams, including class and sequence diagrams, are provided to illustrate system behavior, particularly for the subscription process. The database schema is implemented in MySQL, and pre-filled data is included for testing.

The Audio Streaming Information System is a Java-based application developed for managing users, audio recordings, and subscription-based access. It allows users to upload, listen to, rate, and favorite audio recordings, as well as subscribe to premium packages. The system is built using Java 8, with a RESTful API powered by Spring Boot, and communicates between services using Java Message Service (JMS). Data is stored in a MySQL database, which manages users, audio metadata, playback history, ratings, and subscriptions. The client application features a graphical user interface (GUI) built in Java, providing an intuitive way for users to interact with the system.

The system follows a client-server architecture, consisting of a Java SE client application, a central server, and three microservices (subsystems). The client application interacts with users via a GUI or console interface, sending REST API requests to the central server. The central server processes requests and delegates them to the appropriate subsystem using JMS-based messaging. Each subsystem is responsible for different aspects of the system, such as user management, audio metadata, and subscription handling.
